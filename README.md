# Hi 👋 I'm Jeremy Langer

I'm a tech lead and software engineer with 15 years of experience building scalable web applications with clean, performant code. I'm detail-oriented, collaborative, and care deeply about creating seamless user experiences that drive real business value.

## A few of my core beliefs

### 📖 Lifelong learner

I believe the best engineers never stop learning. Growth happens when you lean into challenges, stay curious, and get comfortable with the uncomfortable.

### ✨ Excellence over perfection

Perfectionism can get in the way of progress. I care deeply about code quality and UX, but always in service of delivering real value efficiently.

### 🚲 Start before you're ready

Progress beats hesitation. Whether it's code, a design, or a decision, build the first version and iterate quickly. That's how learning happens.

### ❓ Question the status quo

Great products aren't built on autopilot. I ask hard questions, challenge assumptions, and seek context to make smart, user-driven decisions.

## Quick Code Facts

Here's how I approach writing software. Strong opinions, loosely held.

- **Write less code** - all code is technical debt. I get excited when I see a PR that has more lines removed than added.
- **Balance doing things "right" vs. iterating quickly** - the goal is to solve business problems, not to write elegant code; however, you should still aim to have both.
- **Readable code > short code** - write code for the people who actually read it, not the computers that run it. This isn't mutually exclusive to writing performant code. As with the point above, I aim to have both.
- **Code should be self documenting** - the most appropriate time for comments is answering "why", not "what". If you still feel like you need a comment, more likely it needs to be refactored.

## Outside of work

When I'm not at my desk, you can find me:

- 🏋️‍♂️ Lifting weights
- 🍎 Healthy eating and living
- 🎧 Listening to deep house
- 📚 Reading bedtime stories to my kids
- 🌌 Somewhere deep in my Notion or Figma organizing my life
