# Hi 👋 I'm Jeremy Langer

I'm a detail-oriented software engineer with 14 years of experience and a positive mindset.

I'm passionate about creating beautiful web apps with clean, performant code.

There are a few things you should know about me...

## A few of my core beliefs

### 📖 Lifelong learning

I'm a big believer in continually learning, evolving, and growing. If you're not growing, you're just existing. Get curious! I've learned to love that feeling of a proper challenge, as it's in those moments when true growth occurs.

### ✨ Aim for excellence, not perfection

I used to be a perfectionist, but I've experienced perfection as the enemy of getting things done. Focus your efforts on the things that really matter and do them well. 80/20 rule.

### 🚲 Get started before you're ready

I try to outsmart inertia by starting before I'm ready. The best way to learn is by doing, and you can only refine something once it's taken a form. You can't learn to ride a bike by reading - you have to experience it.

### ❓ Question the status quo

Innovation has never been struck by only following best practices. I ask clarifying questions and gather lots of context to feel empowered to make the best decisions. Don't blindly follow directives - the best businesses hire curious humans, not robots.

## Quick Code Facts

Here's my general approach to writing code. As with everything else, these are strong opinions, loosely held.

- **Write less code** - all code is technical debt. I get excited when I see a PR that has more lines removed than added.
- **Balance doing things "right" vs. iterating quickly** - the goal is to solve business problems, not to write elegant code; however, you should still aim to have both.
- **Readable code > short code** - write code for the people who actually read it, not the computers that run it. This isn't mutually exclusive to writing performant code. As with the point above, I aim to have both.
- **Code should be self documenting** - the only appropriate time for comments is answering "why", not "what". If you still feel like you need a comment, more likely it needs to be refactored.

## The rest of it

When I'm not at my desk, you can find me:

- 🏋️‍♂️ Lifting weights
- 🍎 Healthy eating and living
- 🎧 Listening to deep house
- 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Reading the kids a bedtime story
- 🌌 Somewhere deep in my Notion or Figma organizing my life
